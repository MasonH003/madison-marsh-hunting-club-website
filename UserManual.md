# User Manual

Welcome to the Madison Marsh Hunting Club this guide is to understand how to use the website both as an administrator and a user. If you are not interested in creating an account, feel free to scroll
throughout the website to view our home and informational pages using the top navigation bar. 

### User Guide

As of now, anyone is capable of creating an account/logging in by clicking the big sign up button on the image carousel or by clicking the "Account" button on the top navigation bar. You can register
on the platform using your email as a verification. Upon checking your email you may then access the website with user privileges. Functionality to some of the features on the website are still in development.

### Admin Guide

In the meantime, the only way to change user privileges is within the Supabase platform. Heres how you do it.

1) Using the credentials given to Supabase, click on the MMHC "Project"
2) Hover over on the left navigation bar of the website and click on "Table Editor"
3) Within the "Table Editor", click on the "userdata" tab
4) Find the user by username and click on their row cell underneath the "permissions" column
5) Change for privileges: 1-Guest, 2-Member, 3-Admin

As an administrator you can change/edit some of the features on the website such as our Newsfeed section on the homepage. To access the admin view on the homepage, simply click the blue button at the top right
of the navigation bar that says "admin view." This will make it so all the editable products on the website are accessable to edit. Then, by scrolling to the Newsfeed section on the homepage, bright blue edit or create news buttons will show. Clicking on any of one of these buttons will open modals to edit,create, and delete the article.
